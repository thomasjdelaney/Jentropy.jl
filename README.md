Jentropy.jl
================

A Julia package for entropy and mutual information calculations. Inspired by the Pyentropy package by Robin Ince:
    https://github.com/robince/pyentropy

* Allows calculation of entropy of random variables.
* No need to pre-calculate the probability distribution of the data.
* Designed for calculation of response and stimulus entropies.
* Capable of calculation with multivariate, multitrial data.

**Note:** Bias reduction techniques to be added in the future.
